                    <h1>Our Journey</h1>
                        <p>We started off as a team of 4 friends from a city called San Ramon in California, 3 years ago. We all studied together until we went to college. One afternoon, we decided to meet up for some coffee and snacks and were talking about how boring our jobs are and how we would do so much more with our knowledge and motivation to help those around us. That afternoon we discovered that we all have interest in organizing parties and events. So that is where the idea to start helping people organize their events started. Eventually, we grew from a team of 4 to 10. Now, the 4 of us have a company that we can call our own and employees who share the same enthusiasm as us in helping others!</p>
